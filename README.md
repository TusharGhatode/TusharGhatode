## ⚠️ Please Note: Free Hosting Service

**This project is hosted on a free-tier hosting service**, which may cause a loading delay of **30-40 seconds** for the first request. This delay occurs because the server might need to wake up from a "sleep" state, as free-tier hosting services typically spin down the backend when not in active use. Once the project is loaded, performance will normalize.

Thank you for your patience!
